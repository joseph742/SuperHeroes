# iOS Test retrospect

# Appreciation
Thanks for the opportunity to show my skills and proficiency. I hope I am able to convince you after going through my solution that I truly deserve the position of an iOS developer at Wallapop

# Architecture
In choosing an architecture for this project; I decided to go with the MVVM architecture, I chose this architecture as it would provide me the opportunity to make this project very scalable and also enable other developers to simultaneously work on it as seamlessly as possible. It also would decouple the code for reusability and testability. And also make it easy to add new features in the future.

# Hypothetical improvements
Some improvements I would consider for this project would include.
1. The ability to extract better description from an extenal source in situation where description unavailable.
2. The ability to share images to social media
3. Since the whole idea came about from the need to see which super hero was better. I believe a possible improvemt woould be to able to rate the Super Heros based on super powers.
